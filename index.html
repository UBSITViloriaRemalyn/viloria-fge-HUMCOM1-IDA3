    <h1><em>SDG 4- Quality Education</em></h1>
    <h3><b>How Does Information Technology Contribute To This SDG?</b></h3>
    <p>Regarding SDG 4, technology can greatly enhance access to quality education.
        Digital technologies, including e-learning platforms,
        can break down barriers to education, such as geographical distance,socio-economic status, and physical disabilities. 
        They can also enrich the learning process by enabling personalized, student-centered learning experiences.</p>

    <p>Progress towards quality education was already slower than required before the pandemic,
        but COVID-19 has had devastating impacts on education, causing learning losses in four
        out of five of the 104 countries studied. To achieve national Goal 4 benchmarks,
        which are reduced in ambition compared with the original Goal 4 targets, 79 low- and
        lower-middle- income countries still face an average annual financing gap of $97 billion.</p>
        
    <h3><em>Goal Targets of this SDG</em></h3>
